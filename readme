For correct use of this project need to create special config for php and include him to nginx

1. Go to /etc/php/{version}/fpm/pool.d/ and copy www.conf to user.conf
2. In user.conf wrote next
[user]
user = {username} # under this user we make operations on the server
group = dmitry
listen = /run/php/php7.4-user.sock #custom name for nginx
3. In /etc/php/{version}/fpm/php.ini set max_execution_time = 120

4. In n/etc/nginx/ginx.conf set fastcgi_read_timeout 120;
3. Go to /etc/nginx/sites-available/switcher.conf
4. In location location ~ \.php$  set
fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-user.sock;
