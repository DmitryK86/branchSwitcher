[user]
user =
[user]
user = {username} # under this user we make operations on the server
group = {username}
listen = /run/php/php7.4-user.sock
listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 5
pm.start_servers = 2
pm.min_spare_servers = 1
pm.max_spare_servers = 3
chdir = /

3. In /etc/php/{version}/fpm/php.ini set max_execution_time = 120

4. In n/etc/nginx/ginx.conf set fastcgi_read_timeout 120;
3. Go to /etc/nginx/sites-available/switcher.conf
